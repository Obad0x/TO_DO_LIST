# Note Demon App Readme

Note Demon is a full-stack web application that I developed with the goal of learning more about full-stack development and improving my skills. The app serves as a simple note-taking platform, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete notes. It also features user authentication through a login and signup system.

## Features

- User Authentication: Users can sign up for an account or log in if they already have one. This ensures that their notes are securely stored and accessible only to them.

- Note Creation: Once logged in, users can easily create new notes, giving them the ability to jot down their thoughts, ideas, or any important information.

- Note Storage: The app utilizes a database to save and organize the notes for each user. This ensures that their notes are available even if they access the app from a different device or after logging out.

- Note Management: Users can view their existing notes, edit them as needed, and also delete notes that are no longer required.

## Technologies Used

Note Demon was built using a simple tech stack that includes:

- HTML: For creating the structure and layout of the web pages.
- CSS: To style the app and make it visually appealing.
- JavaScript: For implementing the interactivity and functionality of the app.
- Bootstrap: To enhance the app's responsiveness and overall user experience.

## Running the App

As a unique aspect of the project, Note Demon was developed entirely on a mobile device using Termux, which demonstrates the flexibility of modern development tools.

To run the app on your own device:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open Termux on your Android device.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Use a web server to serve the files (e.g., `python -m http.server`).
5. Access the app in your mobile browser by visiting the server address.

## Disclaimer

Please note that Note Demon was primarily created as a learning project, and it may not be suitable for production-level use. Security and performance aspects might not be as robust as in professional applications built with dedicated frameworks and libraries.

## Contribution

As this is a personal learning project, I may not actively maintain or accept contributions to the codebase. However, I am open to feedback and suggestions for improvement.

Thank you for your interest in Note Demon! I hope you find it useful and insightful for your own learning journey in full-stack development. Happy note-taking!
